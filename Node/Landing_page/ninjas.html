    <h1>Ninjas </h1>
    <h3>Ninja (忍者) were a type of warrior who specialized in unconventional warfare such as infiltration,<br>
        sabotage and assassination during the age of the samurai. Another way of calling them is "shinobi",<br>
        meaning "those who act in stealth". Ninja employed deception and forgery tactics to take opponents <br>
        out by surprise. Due to their unorthodox methods which contradicted the way of the warrior (bushido),<br>
        the ninja were not credited with the same honor as the samurai.
